This project demonstrates a seamless integration of Artificial Intelligence Based Hyper Realistic Character within Unreal Engine 5

It goes beyond a static model to deliver a truly intelligent and interactive digital human:

Ultimate Realism (MetaHuman): The character uses high-fidelity MetaHuman assets, featuring dynamic lip-sync and realistic facial expressions driven entirely by the AI's dialogue stream

Real-Time Intelligence: The character is powered by Convai's LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities, allowing for natural, human-like conversations and deep understanding of player input.

Aware of the World (Scene Perception): The character is aware of specific objects and locations in the UE5 scene (e.g., "the axe," "the tree stump") and uses this contextual knowledge to inform its responses.

Actionable Intelligence: It can translate player commands (like "follow me" or "walk there") from natural language into in-game movement and actions, leveraging UE5's NavMesh system.
